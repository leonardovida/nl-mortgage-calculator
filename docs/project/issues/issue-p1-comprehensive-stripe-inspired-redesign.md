# Issue P1: Comprehensive Stripe-Inspired Page Redesign

**Issue ID**: P1-STRIPE-REDESIGN  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Status**: Open  
**Created**: 2025-06-18  
**Assignee**: Claude Code  

## Description

Apply modern, Stripe-inspired design principles throughout the entire mortgage calculator application. Building on the successful header redesign, extend the sophisticated visual approach to all components, forms, tables, and interactions.

## Design Philosophy

### Stripe Design Principles to Apply
1. **Clean Minimalism**: Remove visual clutter, focus on essential elements
2. **Sophisticated Typography**: Clear hierarchy, varied font weights, proper spacing
3. **Subtle Depth**: Light shadows, gradients, and layering without overdoing it
4. **Professional Color Palette**: Blues, grays, whites with strategic accent colors
5. **Generous Spacing**: Breathing room between elements, proper padding/margins
6. **Interactive Feedback**: Smooth transitions, hover states, focus indicators

## Current Design Issues

### Components Needing Redesign
1. **Cards**: Basic shadcn/ui cards need more sophistication
2. **Form Inputs**: Could be more modern and polished
3. **Tables**: Dense layouts need better readability
4. **Tabs**: Basic styling needs enhancement
5. **Buttons**: Could use better visual hierarchy
6. **Overall Layout**: Needs better section organization

### 3. Professional Tables
```
Current: Basic table layouts
Target:  Clean, readable data presentation
```

**Enhancements:**
- Better row spacing and typography
- Subtle zebra striping
- Enhanced header styling
- Better number formatting display
- Responsive table behavior

### 4. Sophisticated Tabs
```
Current: Basic tab navigation
Target:  Modern tab system with smooth transitions
```

**Features:**
- Smooth indicator animations
- Better spacing and typography
- Enhanced active/inactive states
- Improved mobile responsiveness

### 5. Enhanced Layout Structure
```
Current: Standard container layouts
Target:  More sophisticated section organization
```

**Improvements:**
- Better section separation
- Enhanced visual hierarchy
- Improved spacing system
- Professional background treatments

## Technical Implementation

### Color System Enhancement
```css
/* Professional Palette */
- Primary: slate-900, blue-600
- Secondary: slate-600, indigo-500  
- Backgrounds: slate-50, blue-50, indigo-50
- Accents: green-500, amber-500, red-500

```

### Typography Hierarchy
```css
/* Enhanced Font System */
- Headings: font-bold, tracking-tight, proper scale
- Body: font-normal, leading-relaxed
- Captions: font-medium, text-sm
- Numbers: font-mono for better alignment
```

### Shadow System
```css
/* Sophisticated Depth */
- Cards: shadow-sm with subtle borders
- Interactive: shadow-md on hover
- Elevated: shadow-lg for modals/overlays
- Subtle: ring-1 ring-slate-200 for light borders
```

### Animation System
```css
/* Smooth Micro-interactions */
- Transitions: transition-all duration-200 ease-out
- Hover states: transform, shadow, color changes
- Focus states: ring-2 ring-blue-500 ring-offset-2
- Loading states: pulse animations
```
